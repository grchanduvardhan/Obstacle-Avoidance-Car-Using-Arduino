# Obstacle-Avoidance-Car-Using-Arduino
Developed an autonomous obstacle-avoidance car using an Arduino microcontroller. The car employs an ultrasonic sensor for real-time obstacle detection and a motor driver shield to navigate around them. This project demonstrates proficiency in embedded systems, C/C++ programming, and hands-on electronics integration.
