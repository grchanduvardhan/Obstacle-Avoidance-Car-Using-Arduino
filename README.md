Obstacle Avoidance Car Using Arduino

---

Introduction
This project details the creation of an **autonomous obstacle-avoidance car**. The car is designed to navigate its environment by detecting obstacles using an **ultrasonic sensor** and maneuvering around them without human intervention. The core of the system is an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller, which processes sensor data and controls the vehicle's movement through a **motor driver shield**. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in robotics, including sensor integration, motor control, and embedded programming.

Components
1. Arduino Uno – Microcontroller board for controlling the system logic
2. Motor Driver Shield – Drives the motors based on Arduino signals
3. TT Gear Motors (4x) – Provide movement to the wheels
4. Wheels (4x) – Attached to gear motors for mobility
5. Servo Motor – Rotates the ultrasonic sensor for directional scanning
6. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) – Detects obstacles by measuring distance
7. 18650 Li-ion Battery (2x) – Powers the car
8. 18650 Battery Holder – Holds and connects the batteries
9. Male & Female Jumper Wires – For circuit connections
10. Acrylic Sheet – Chassis base for mounting components
11. DC Power Switch – Controls power supply to the system
